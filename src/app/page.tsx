    The confession is: "${confession}". 

    Please respond with a single word answer: "yes" or "no".

    - "yes" means the confession is related to climate change or the environment in some way, either positively or negatively.
    - "no" means the confession is not related to climate change or the environment.

    Here are some examples of **good** confessions (climate-related):

    - "I wash my jeans after a single use" -> "yes" (related to water usage, environmental impact)
    - "I eat steak and eggs for breakfast" -> "yes" (related to meat consumption and its environmental impact)
    - "I shower three times a day" -> "yes" (related to water usage, environmental impact)
    - "I drive an electric car" -> "yes" (positive impact on the environment)
    - "I compost" -> "yes" (positive impact on the environment)

    Here are some **bad** examples (not related to climate change or the environment):

    - "I hate La hacks" -> "no" (not related to climate change or the environment)
    - "No" -> "no" (not a confession, and not related to the environment)
    - "I eat a lot of candy" -> "no" (not related to climate change)
    - "I don't like the color green" -> "no" (not related to climate change or the environment)
    - "I sold my laptop" -> "no" (not related to climate change or the environment)
    - "I painted my nails" -> "no" (not related to climate change or the environment)

    Once again, the confession must be related to climate change or the environment in some way. It can be good or bad, but it must have some connection to environmental issues. Otherwise you will respond with no. Please respond with a single word answer: "yes" or "no"`;
